If the moon smiled, she would resemble you. You leave the same impression Of something beautiful, but annihilating.
~Sylvia Plath

The sun gives light; the moon gives illusion. The sun gives so much light that there is little room left for imagination. We do not easily make legends about the sun; but the moon keeps alive that sense of the mystic without which we might as well be in the prehistoric cave or jungle. The people are on the side of the poets. We have folk tales by the hundred — of the man who tried to rake the moon out of the pond, of the exhilarated cow that jumped over the moon, of the moon’s being made of green cheese (albeit there is no life on it), of goats dancing on their hind-legs at full of moon, of the man in the moon, and that sumptuous dream of fairytales— the blue moon. Popular fancy delights to play with the moon. Elves and pixies hold their revels and eisteddfods in the moonlit glades; leprechauns roam the woods; and Puck is loosed to play his nocturnal pranks. Human lovers take their walks in a world of moonshine. Always there is this association of glamour and witchery with moonlight; and as long as the moon endures, the common people will believe in that elusive beauty which restores the illusions banished by day.
Robery Wray, The Atlantic, March 1922
