      <h3>Exercise 1: Personal Class Website with Homepage</h3>
      <p>Your personal class website will be used to store and present all exercises, journal entries and projects. It is your personal space so it should evolve over the course of the semester as your knowledge grows. It can be designed any way you'd like, 
        the only requirements are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A homepage which includes links to exercises, journal entries and projects</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We'll be using the GitHub developer platform to host the websites. The website will be stored in a "repository" which you can think of as a folder on your computer.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Create an account on <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a> (make sure to verify the account) using your Fordham email.</li>
        <li>After you're logged in, go to your main repositories page. Click the NEW button.</li>
        <li>Name your repository whatever you would like (something like “class-site” if you can’t think of anything).</li>
        <li>Select PUBLIC (Anyone on the internet can see this repository).</li>
        <li>Check Add a README file.</li>
        <li>Leave other options as-is.</li>
        <li>Click CREATE REPOSITORY.</li>
        <li>You are now viewing the contents of the repository which is currently empty except for the README file. A README file is simply a description of the contents of the respository. Click the edit icon if you'd like to change the text of the README file.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In order for your repository to be treated and rendered like a website, you need initialize GitHub Pages on this repository. Github pages is a feature offered by github that makes it easy and free to host handmade websites.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click SETTINGS in the top navigation.</li>
        <li>Click PAGES in the left navigation.</li>
        <li>Under BRANCH, select MAIN. Click the SAVE button.</li>
        <li>Wait a few minutes and refresh the page. You will see your repo link: <i>your-github-username.github.io/class-site</i></li>
      </ol>
      <p>As you complete exercises and projects, you will add these files to the repo. In this exercise, we will create a homepage (index.html) but going forward, the process is:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Click CODE in the top navigation.</li>
        <li>Click ADD FILE > UPLOAD FILES.</li>
        <li>Drag the new files or folders to the area indicated. </li>
        <li>COMMIT CHANGES - this is where you add some short description of what you've changed to keep track of your activity (something like "first upload", "updated homepage", "add new project", etc.)</li>
        <li>Wait a few minutes and then check your repo link.</li>
        <li>Add your URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tx2kS4hNLtpRHBaYSWvbtPRGOTKhiUmcNtSiNGlYqQE/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>Note: GitHub has many features, including a desktop app that automatically updates your repo. We will not be using the app but feel free to try out these features on your own computer.</p>

<h3>Exercise 2</h3>
<p><a href="https://pb-fordham.github.io/web/pdfs/dieter.md" target="_blank">Use this text</a> to recreate <i>Ten Principles for Good Design by Dieter Rams</i>. Use what you know about HTML and CSS (also, refer to the <a href="https://pb-fordham.github.io/web/resources.html" target="_blank">resources</a>) and follow these instructions:</p>
<ul>
<li>One page only, a stylesheet and a folder for images</li>
  <li>Include a minimum of <b>five</b> images which demonstrate the principles in your opinion (be creative, do not use Dieter Ram images, you can also create your own images). These can be placed anywhere that makes sense within your design. </li>
  <li>Use as many HTML tags and CSS properties as you'd like.</li>
   <li>In terms of design, think about what the choice of fonts, colors and placement of images says about your design.</li>
</ul>
 <p>Recommended Process:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a local folder "exercise2". Folder should contain index.html, a stylesheet and a sub-folder for images.</li>
<li>When you are ready, upload this entire folder to your GitHub class website. The link should look something like: your-github-username.github.io/class-site/exercise2/. You can continue to edit and re-upload.</li>
<li>Add your URL to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tx2kS4hNLtpRHBaYSWvbtPRGOTKhiUmcNtSiNGlYqQE/edit#gid=0" target="_blank">spreadsheet</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Note: Exercises are not graded but you should hand them in on time.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Design a grid <a href="https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.app/" target="_blank">using this resource</a>. Figure out number of columns and rows, combine areas. Get the code for html and css.</li>
        <li>Modify the html and css. Add background images into each div area. Experiment with the height and width of the div areas. Also experiement with repeating background images, background image sizes (contain, cover).</li>
        <li>Resources for help: <a href="https://learncssgrid.com/" target="_blank">Learn CSS Grid</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_grid.asp" target="_blank">W3 Schools</a>.</li>
<li>When you are ready, upload this entire folder to your GitHub class website. The link should look something like: your-github-username.github.io/class-site/exercise3/. You can continue to edit and re-upload.</li>

<h3>Exercise: Recipe</h3>
<p>This exercise explores hierarchy, layout, legibility and conceptually thinking about styles. </p>
<ol>
<li>Find any recipe on any website. Look at the way it's designed - is it legible? does the design of the page entice you to cook this recipe?</li>
<li>Create a local folder "exercise2". Folder may contain index.html, a stylesheet and a sub-folder for images and other assets.</li>
<li>Use HTML and CSS to design your own version of the recipe. Include a description, instructions, images, source. What is the best way to lay out the recipe so a person can easily follow it? Re-write the recipe or add more images if necessary.</li>
<li>Create another version of this recipe, changing the layout and stylesheet. What are you doing differently in this version? Is the user different? </li>
<li>Pick the <i>best</i> version and upload it to your repo. What does <i>best</i> mean? Why did you pick this version?</li>
<li>Upload this entire folder to your GitHub class website. The link should look something like: <i>your-github-username.github.io/class-site/exercise2/</i></li>
